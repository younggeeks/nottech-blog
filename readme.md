Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email. As John Gruber writes on the Markdown site

    The overriding design goal for Markdown’s
    formatting syntax is to make it as readable
    as possible. The idea is that a
    Markdown-formatted document should be
    publishable as-is, as plain text, without
    looking like it’s been marked up with tags
    or formatting instructions.

This text you see here is actually written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown’s syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.
